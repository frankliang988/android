Personal play ground for testing various features.
The main goal of this playground is to make things "work" under then intended scenario. 
This means the code is not meant to be used in a production environment as is.
Things such as preventing NPE, puting strings in res file, style definition, and etc, is not done in this repo.

Current testable feature:
1) Video trimming: Take a video, if the video is over 5 sec, user can trim the video to desired length, then save the video in "Movies" folder.
